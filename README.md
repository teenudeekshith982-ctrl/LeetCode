# LeetCode
This repository is a collection of my LeetCode solutions, organized by topics such as Arrays, Binary Search, and Databases. I use this space to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), strengthen my problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews at top tech companies. Each solution reflects my approach to writing clean, efficient, and optimized code, and the repository is regularly updated as I continue solving new problems.
